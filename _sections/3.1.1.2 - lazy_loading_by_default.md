  Dropwizard EntityManager configures Jackson to serialize lazy loaded associations by default.  You can configure 
  your EntityManagerBundle to disable this feature.  However, if you do so your resource method will be responsible for 
  initializing all lazily-loaded collections, etc., before returning.

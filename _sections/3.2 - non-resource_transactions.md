## Container Managed Persistence Outside Jersey Resources

Currently creating transactions with the @UnitOfWork annotation works out-of-box only for resources managed by 
Jersey. If you want to use it outside Jersey resources, e.g. in services, you should instantiate your class with 
`UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory`.  If you had a simple PersonService including a @UnitOfWork annotated method:

```java
public class PersonService {
    private final EntityManager entityManager;
    
    public PersonService(EntityManager entityManager) {
        this.entityManager = entityManager;
    }
    
    @UnitOfWork
    public void create(Person person) {
        entityManager.persist(person);
    }
}
```

You would create an instance of that service using a `UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory`:

```java
UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory proxyFactory = new UnitOfWorkAwareProxyFactory(entityManagerBundle);

PersonService personService = proxyFactory.create(
        PersonService.class, 
        EntityManager.class, 
        entityManagerBundle.getSharedEntityManager());
```

This will create a proxy of your class, which will initialize the shared `EntityManager` around 
methods with the @UnitOfWork annotation.  A transaction will also be created around annotated methods unless the 
annotation specifies otherwise.

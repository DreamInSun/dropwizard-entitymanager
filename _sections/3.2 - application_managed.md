## Application Managed Persistence
There may be times when you need to have more control over the `PersistenceContext` or need to manage a new transaction.  
The `EntityManagerFactory` obtained from your `EntityManagerBundle` allows you to create and manage new 
`EntityManager` instances.  Any `EntityManager` created from the factory will have a new `PersistenceContext` 
independent of any `@UnitOfWork` context or transaction.

```java
public void create(Person person) {
    EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
    EntityTransaction transaction = entityManager.getTransaction();
    try {
        transaction.begin();
        entityManager.persist(person);
        transaction.commit();
    } catch (RuntimeException e) {
        if (transaction.isActive()) {
            transaction.rollback();
        }
    } finally {
        entityManager.close();
    }
}
```

## Container Managed Persistence for Resource Methods
The shared `EntityManager` obtained from your `EntityManagerBundle` works with the @UnitOfWork annotation from the 
Dropwizard Hibernate module.  The @UnitOfWork annotation may be applied to resource methods to create a container 
managed `PersistenceContext`.  This gives you the ability to declaratively scope transaction boundaries.  The 
annotation _must_ be present on any resource method that either directly or indirectly uses the shared `EntityManager`.

```java
@POST
@Timed
@UnitOfWork
public Response create(@Valid Person person) {
    entityManager.persist(checkNotNull(person));

    return Response.created(UriBuilder.fromResource(PersonResource.class)
            .build(person.getId()))
            .build();
}
```

This will automatically initialize the `EntityManager`, begin a transaction, call persist, commit the transaction, and 
finally close the `EntityManager`. If an exception is thrown, the transaction is rolled back.

Often you simply need to read data without requiring an actual transaction.
 
```java
@GET
@Timed
@UnitOfWork(transactional = false)
public Person findPerson(@PathParam("id") LongParam id) {
    return entityManager.find(Person.class, id.get());
}
```

This will automatically initialize the `EntityManager`, call find, and finally close the `EntityManager`.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> 
  <div><strong>Note</strong></div> The EntityManager is closed before your resource method’s return value (e.g., the Person from the database), 
which means your resource method is responsible for initializing all lazily-loaded collections, etc., 
before returning. Otherwise, you’ll get a `LazyInitializationException` thrown in your template (or null values 
produced by Jackson).
